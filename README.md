## End to End Machine Learning project to predict student performance

This project is the ML project to predict student's performance based on the given information.
I got dataset from kaggle which shows students' grade, gender, ethnicity, parents' level of education, scores of math, reading, and writing tests.

There is a function that calculates r2_score to evaluate which classifier is the best. 
I consider these classifiers:
 - Random Forest
 - Decision Tree
 - Gradient Boosting
 - Linear Regression
 - K-Neighbors Classifier
 - XGBClassifier
 - CatBoosting Classifier
 - AdaBoost Classifier
   
Let the model trained with the best classifier. 
Then, the model is used to predict student performance with given user input.

# Deploy End To End ML Projects In Production AWS Cloud Using CI CD Pipeline

I made the described backend process with python, and Frontend in Flask, html, and css. 

To deploy this program in AWS, I made settings in IAM User, ECR repository, and EC2 instance.
Connect github and AWS by using Github actions(yaml file) and Docker setted up in EC2 instance.
